Exercise E.30: Implement a 2nd-order Runge-Kutta method; function

Implement the 2nd-order Runge-Kutta method specified in formula (E.38). Use
a plain function RungeKutta2 of the type shown in Sect. E.1.2 for the Forward
Euler method. Construct a test problem where you know the analytical solution,
and plot the difference between the numerical and analytical solution. Demonstrate
that the numerical solution approaches the exact solution as delta-t is reduced.
