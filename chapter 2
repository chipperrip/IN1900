Lists : objects for storing a bunch of shit

lists are type flexible in python


L1 = [-91, 'a string', 7.2, 0]

indices go from 0,1,2,...,len(L1-1)

append, extend, length

append : add element at the end of a list

extend at the end:

C = [a,b,c]
C = C + [d,e]

len(C) length of list, number of elements

for
